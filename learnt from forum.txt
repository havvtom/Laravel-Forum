episode 71

- used middleware to protect the publishing thread route when email is not confirmed
- had to fix the flash vue component so that it can also show when a message is sent from the server

episode 72

- learnt how to fake email
- this can also be learnt from the laravel documents (type Mail Fake)
- fired an event in the RegisterController just after creating a user
- Open a maitrap account to use for testing
- assertStatus(200) when there is a redirect gives an error. Instead use assertRedirect('redirected_page')
- if using mailtrap its wise to restart the server before trying since it uses data that has been cached
- changed the line in RegistersUsers to App\Events\Registered so that the Registered refers to the event that I made
- added another field in the RegisterController (confirmation_token)
- str_rnd no longer works in Laravel 5.7 upwards 
- Used the line (use Illuminate\Support\Str;) and Str::random in the RegisterController
- Not publishing threads, suspects the cache of the channels is the problem
